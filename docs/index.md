This repository contains a collection of things I have created whilst running various [Code Clubs](https://www.codeclub.org.uk) over the years. You are welcome to use them if you find them helpful and feedback is always most welcome.

## Progress Booklets

A 4 page A5 booklet to help children in a club to track their progress as they work through the three Scratch modules on the [Code Club projects page.](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub) They are correct as of the end of 2021.

Download the PDF [here](https://github.com/jrmhaig/Code_Club_Resources/raw/master/ProgressBooklets/ScratchProgress.pdf).

## Reaction

A simple reaction game using electronics with a Raspberry Pi. This project is nearly 10 years old now so it will almost certainly need updating, not least because it uses Python 2. It has been copied and updated in various places including [here.](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/python-quick-reaction-game)

## Sierpinski

An interactive project to create a [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpiński_triangle) in Python. The code samples are intended as a guide for the teacher to explain each step and the students are expected to already have some experience with Python and the Turtle graphics module.

Find the code [here.](https://github.com/jrmhaig/Code_Club_Resources/tree/master/Sierpinski)

## Space Invaders

A worksheet for building the classic Space Invaders game using PyGame. I have no idea what state this is in now. _Caveat emptor._

## Turtle Intro

My first venture into Python with 11-year-olds. I don't know how helpful it is now and it possibly contains a [copyright infringement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch%C3%A9_Turtle_and_Dum_Dum)
