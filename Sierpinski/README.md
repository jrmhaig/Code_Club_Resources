These are the notes I created for a walk-through to making a Sierpinski gasket
in Python using the turtle module. I did this with a
[CodeClub](http://www.codeclub.org.uk) made up of year 6s who had completed
lessons 1-4 of the term 4 syllabus and so all the comments assume that level of
knowledge.

The code is not written to be given out but rather as a guide for the teacher.

I managed to get through everything except part 3 (function to choose a random
start position and corners) in a little over an hour.

It is probably better not to use random points after all.
